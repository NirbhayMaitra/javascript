/* 
Primitive (Call By Value)
7 types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

Non-Primitive (Call By Reference)
Arrays, Objects, Functions 

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that types are associated with values rather than variables, 
and the type of a variable is determined at runtime. Here are some key characteristics of dynamically typed languages like JavaScript:

Type Inference at Runtime: The type of a variable is determined when the code is executed, not when it is written.
Flexibility: Variables can hold values of any type and can be reassigned to different types over their lifetime.
No Explicit Type Declarations: You do not need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.
For example, in JavaScript, you can write:

javascript
Copy code
let x = 42;    // x is a number
x = "Hello";   // Now x is a string
x = true;      // Now x is a boolean
This flexibility contrasts with statically typed languages, where the type of a variable is known at compile time and usually must be explicitly declared and cannot change. Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C++, and TypeScript (which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript).
